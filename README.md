# SepsisMDW
 This is the code and data repository for the article "Complete Blood Count and MDW-based Machine Learning Algorithms for Sepsis Detection: a Multicentric Development and External Validation Study".

 Only the OGSA-ICU dataset is publicly available: access to the other datasets may be made available upon reasonable request to the authors. Thus, only the External Validation can be used with the data directly available in the repository: comment out notebook cells related to datasets other than OGSA-ICU.
